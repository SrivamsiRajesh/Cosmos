# Cosmosile ðŸŒ 

Cosmosile is a platform designed to encourage community engagement in astronomy, allowing users to discover and share local events. Although it was initiated by a single creator, it aspires to become a collaborative space where enthusiasts can participate and contribute. The platform provides resources and tools to facilitate connections among astronomy lovers. By inviting users to submit their events and join discussions, Cosmosile seeks to build a vibrant community around the shared interest in space exploration. ðŸš€

# Story ðŸ“–

I am a high school senior aspiring to major in aerospace engineering with a minor in electrical engineering. In my school, we have an astronomy club, but it is not very active. As a person who loves astronomy, I wanted to build something that connects people and fosters an appreciation for the beauty of space. ðŸŒŒ

# Technical Part ðŸ’»

I used Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and various packages and APIs for the website. I have listed them below:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React framework)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Utility-first CSS framework)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) (Form handling library)
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) (Object schema validation)
- [@react-three/fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) (React renderer for Three.js)
- [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) (Useful helpers for @react-three/fiber)
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) (Icon library)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (Animation library)
- [NASA Night Sky Network (NSN) API](https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/) (for astronomy events)
- [News API](https://newsapi.org/) (for space-related news)
- [Rocket Launches API](https://launchlibrary.net/) (for upcoming rocket launch information)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Database)
- [Spline](https://spline.design/) (3D design tool)

# Hackathon Experience ðŸš€

I discovered this hackathon on September 1st, and I knew it was the perfect opportunity to showcase my technical skills and express my love for space. One of the biggest challenges I faced during development was with the database structure I used. It was my first time working with MongoDB for backend development, which presented some learning curves. Despite the challenges, it was a fantastic learning experience that allowed me to grow and improve my skills in web development. ðŸŒŒ

# Learnings ðŸ§ 

I learned a lot during this project. I improved my designing skills and also started working with backend development. I implemented a starry effect on the website to match the space theme and learned how to integrate multiple APIs. It was a great project that honed my skills in various areas of web development. ðŸŒŸ
